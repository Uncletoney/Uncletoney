- 👋 Hi, I’m @Uncletoney
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborating on a project that will be in need for many years from now, actually I see no end for a need of this project.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching and reaching out to programmers and hope you make contact with me as quickly as possible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find one or several programers that will collaborate on an Energy Efficiency Software, Engine built already, project that is described here: The OpenStudio-ERI project allows calculating an Energy Rating Index (ERI) using the Department of Energy's open-source OpenStudio/EnergyPlus simulation platform. The building description is provided in an HPXML file format.

The project supports:

ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301© Standard for the Calculation and Labeling of the Energy Performance of Dwelling and Sleeping Units using an Energy Rating Index
ENERGY STAR Certification System for Homes and Apartments Using an Energy Rating Index-Based Compliance Path. This software will and can be used Nationwide, and Globally as well.
- 📫 How to reach me: toney@uncletoney.com  Make contact and ask how lucrutive it could be?
